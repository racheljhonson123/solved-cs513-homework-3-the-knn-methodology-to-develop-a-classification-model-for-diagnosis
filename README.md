The “breast cancer dataset” in CANVAS was obtained from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison from Dr. William H. Wolberg. The features in the dataset, described below, have been categorized from 1 to 10.

Use the knn methodology to develop a classification model for the Diagnosis.

Important: make sure your categories are represented by the “factor” data type in R and delete the rows with missing value. Use 30% test 70% training data.
